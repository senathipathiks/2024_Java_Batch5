    <h1> About us </h1>
    <p>We start with the digital magazine of the Taj RESIDENCY in Amsterdam, a good example of the magazine format’s flexibility that adapts to the different stages of the buyer’s journey.

        Among the articles tackling the top of the funnel audiences, lists of traditional Dutch food travellers cannot miss out on or activities in the Dutch capital depending on the time of the year are included.
        These inspiring and informative articles about gastronomy, leisure, and culture in the city fit perfectly with other types of content that are aimed at helping their future guests familiarise themselves with the hotel’s surroundings.

        What’s more, it gets them to visualise themselves in the experiences and moments described. Take a look at the introduction of their article on their winter garden.</p>
