Types of VCS
    2 types:
        1.Centralized VCS - It doesn't have a backup. If the server is corrupted then, we can't able to access it.
        Eg: SVN

        2.Distributed VCS - We have a Centralized server and in between there is a main layer to maintain the repository. So, the single server failure is resolved.
        Eg: For local we are using Git and for remote we are using Github and BitBucket. Git is a distributed Version Control System.

Git is a Local repository.
Github is a cloud based repository.
