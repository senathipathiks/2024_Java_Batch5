Yesterday morning we started with Behaviour Session. In that session, remaining two teams continued 
the Icebreaker activity by concluding the Amilia's story. After that, We entered into the topic of Active Listening 
and did an activity like we have to read a short headline of a news and a person from other team need to describe it.
After Behaviour session, sena came and taught us about exception handling. Post lunch, sena gave some tasks
on exception handling and then we went for physical fitness.
