        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Theme parks are a part of the greater attractions industry. Theme parks are large, mostly outdoor, 
            entertainment enterprises that trace their origins back to 19th century pleasure gardens that, over time, 
            converted to amusement parks with a mix of entertainment including rides, shows, games, and food and beverage 
            offerings. Beginning in the 1950s with the opening of Walt Disney’s Disneyland, the theme park sector has 
            expanded throughout the global economy. Today, the annual attendance at the world’s largest and most attended 
            theme parks is 323.4 million; it is likely that a comparable level of attendance is achieved by the second tier 
            of theme parks throughout the world.</p>
