        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Hotel website designs really do vary. I’ve seen some truly wild flash animations, slow-loading background video, complicated templates… Some of this stuff looks cool, but does it actually help your property get direct bookings?

            I can’t overstate the importance of a well-designed hotel website.
            
            But you need to have a balance of form AND function.
            
            OTA commission fees range anywhere from 15-30%. If you want to increase direct bookings, you have to have your own website. Simple, right?
            
            Well, there’s a bit more to it than that. “If you build it, they will come,” might’ve worked in Field of Dreams, but friend, this is the real world. Folks aren’t going to magically stumble onto your hotel website, just because you built one. And once they’re on it, there’s also no guarantee they’ll book direct.
            
            So how do you get them there? How do you get them to stick around, instead of clicking away to their favorite OTA? And importantly, how do you get them to make that direct booking? Good design doesn’t mean a ton of bells and whistles.
            
            The hotel website examples I include below prove that sometimes, less is more!</p>
